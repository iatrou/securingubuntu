= Ensure Apport is not installed.

== Description

Ensure that the `apport` service is not installed.

== Rationale

Apport collects potentially sensitive data, such as core dumps, stack traces,
and log files. They can contain passwords, credit card numbers, serial numbers,
and other private material.

== Audit

[source,shell]
----
packageInstalled() {
  dpkg -l | awk '{print $1, $2}' | grep "^ii.* $1"
}

@test "Verify that apport is not installed" {
  run packageInstalled 'apport'
  [ "$status" -eq 1 ]
}
----

== Remediation

=== shell

[source,shell]
----
apt-get --assume-yes purge apport*
