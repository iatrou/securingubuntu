= Ensure that /etc/default/whoopsie do not exist.

== Description

Ensure that the `whoopsie` packages are purged and `/etc/default/whoopsie` has been
removed.

== Rationale

`Whoopsie` collects the crash report generated by `Apport` and makes it possible
to send them to Canonical.

== Audit

----
@test "Verify that /etc/default/whoopsie do not exist" {
  run bash -c "stat /etc/default/whoopsie"
  [ "$status" -eq 1 ]
}
----

== Remediation

=== shell

[source,shell]
----
apt-get --assume-yes purge whoopsie*
rm /etc/default/whoopsie
