= Ensure Apport is masked

== Description

Ensure that the `apport` service is masked if it is required to be installed.

== Rationale

Apport collects potentially sensitive data, such as core dumps, stack traces,
and log files. They can contain passwords, credit card numbers, serial numbers,
and other private material.

== Audit

[source,shell]
----
isMasked() {
  isMasked=$(systemctl is-enabled "$1")
  if [[ "$isMasked" = "masked" ]]; then
    exit 0
  else
    exit 1
  fi
}

@test "Verify that apport is masked" {
  run isMasked apport.service
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
}
----

== Remediation

=== shell

[source,shell]
----
sed -i 's/enabled=.*/enabled=0/' /etc/default/apport
systemctl stop apport.service
systemctl mask apport.service
----
