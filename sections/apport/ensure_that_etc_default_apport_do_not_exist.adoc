= Ensure that /etc/default/apport do not exist

== Description

Ensure that the `apport` packages are purged and `/etc/default/apport` has been
removed.

== Rationale

Apport collects potentially sensitive data, such as core dumps, stack traces,
and log files. They can contain passwords, credit card numbers, serial numbers,
and other private material.

== Audit

[source,shell]
----
@test "Verify that /etc/default/apport do not exist" {
  run bash -c "stat /etc/default/apport"
  [ "$status" -eq 1 ]
}
----

== Remediation

=== shell

[source,shell]
----
apt-get --assume-yes purge apport*
rm /etc/default/apport
----
