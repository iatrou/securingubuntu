= Verify that UFW is installed

== Description

Verify that `ufw`, the "Uncomplicated Firewall", is installed.

== Rationale

The default firewall configuration tool for Ubuntu is ufw. Developed to ease
iptables firewall configuration, ufw provides a user friendly way to create
an IPv4 or IPv6 host-based firewall. By default UFW is disabled.
