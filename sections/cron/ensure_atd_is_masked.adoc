= Ensure atd is masked

== Description

The `at` and `batch` commands can be used to schedule tasks that are meant
to be executed only once. This allows delayed execution in a manner similar
to `cron`, except that it is not recurring.

== Rationale

The `atd` service could be used by an unsophisticated insider to carry out
activities outside of a normal login session, which could complicate
accountability. Furthermore, the need to schedule tasks with `at` or `batch`
is not common.

== Audit

[source,shell]
----
isMasked() {
  isMasked=$(systemctl is-enabled "$1")
  if [[ "$isMasked" = "masked" ]]; then
    exit 0
  else
    exit 1
  fi
}

@test "Ensure atd is masked" {
  run isMasked atd.service
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
}
----

== Remediation

----

systemctl stop atd.service
systemctl daemon-reload
----

=== Ansible
