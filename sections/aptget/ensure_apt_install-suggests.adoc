= Ensure APT has Install-Suggests configured

== Description

The `Install-Suggests` setting makes `apt-get` or `apt` not consider
suggested packages as a dependency for installing.

== Rationale

Reducing the amount of installed packages might reduce any attack surface.

== Audit

[source,shell]
----
@test "Verify APT Install-Suggests" {
  run bash -c "grep '^APT::Install-Suggests \"false\";$' /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/*"
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
}
----

== Remediation

=== shell

[source,shell]
----
if ! grep '^APT::Install-Suggests' /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/*; then
  echo 'APT::Install-Suggests "false";' >> /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01-vendor-ubuntu
else
  sed -i 's/.*APT::Install-Suggests.*/APT::Install-Suggests "false";/g' "$(grep -l 'APT::Install-Suggests' /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/*)"
fi
----

=== Ansible
