= Ensure APT has Remove-Unused-Dependencies configured

== Description

The Remove-Unused-Dependencies setting removes all unused dependencies after
a upgrade has finished.

== Rationale

Reducing the amount of installed packages might reduce any attack surface.

== Audit

[source,shell]
----
@test "Verify APT Remove-Unused-Dependencies" {
  run bash -c "grep '^Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies \"true\";$' /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/*"
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
}
----

== Remediation

=== shell

[source,shell]
----
if ! grep '^Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies' /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/*; then
  echo 'Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies "true";' >> /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades
else
  sed -i 's/.*Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies.*/Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies "true";/g' "$(grep -l 'Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies' /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/*)"
fi
