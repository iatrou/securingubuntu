= Verify that UFW is installed

== Description

Verify that `ufw`, the "Uncomplicated Firewall", is installed.

== Rationale

When you turn UFW on, it uses a default set of rules (profile)
that should be fine for the average home user. That's at least
the goal of the Ubuntu developers. In short, all 'incoming' is being denied,
with some exceptions to make things easier for home users.

== Audit

[source,shell]
----
@test "Verify that UFW is installed" {
  run bash -c "dpkg -l | grep ii.*ufw.*firewall"
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
}
----

== Remediation
